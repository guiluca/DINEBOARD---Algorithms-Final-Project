# DINEBOARD---Algorithms-Final-Project
In our algorithms class in IE University, we developed a system to help small restaurants manage their business, with tools that facilitated tracking, as well as searches and running the restaurant. At the time however we were only required to create the back-end of the project, so to finalize it we created a front-end, fixed bugs and made it more interactive. It is a very simple project that was developed to help a family member of one of our group members run her restaurant more efficiently.
