# DINEBOARD---Algorithms-Final-Project
In our algorithms class we developed a system to help small restaurants manage their business, with tools that facilitated tracking as well as searches. At the time however we were only required to create the back-end of the project, so to finalize it when created a front-end, fixed bugs and made it more interactive, and now we will ad it to GitHub
